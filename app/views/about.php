		    <h5 class="mt-5">My Skills and Experiences</h5>
		    <p>Well, I have just completed my Bachelors of Computer Application in the year 2020 in the middle of the global pandamic COVID-19 and now I am just a fresher without a job but searching for a job. I love to gain knowledge on various fields and hence utilised this time to learn various things. I have knowledge on the front-end side of the Web, i.e., HyperText Markup Language(HTML), Cascading Style Sheet(CSS), CSS Framework Bootstrap, JavaScript(JS), JS library jQuery and Sweetalert. I have also aquired knowledge on the backend of the Web which I develop with:
		    	<ul>
		    		<li>Core PHP and MySQL</li>
		    		<li>PHP mini framework FuelPHP</li>
		    		<li>PHP framework CodeIgniter</li>
		    		<li>Python mini framework Flask</li>
		    	</ul>
		    I also have basic knowledge on Python application development with Python modules like
		    	<ul>
		    		<li>Tkinter</li>
		    		<li>PyQt5</li>
		    	</ul>
		    I am eager to learn more as you may know that all worldly material may go away but only our knowledge can stay with us. And until I have knowledge, I can aquire all the things I loose and much more.
		    </p>
		    <h5 class="mt-5">Side Projects</h5>
		    <p>I have always tried to make differnt projects to furnish my skills. Some I have completed and some I couldn't completed due to some reason and later lost interest in completing those.
		    	In my Summer Training and in college I have done total 3 group projects which was not easy to do with a group but helped to learn how to cooperate in a team.
		    	<ul>
		    		<li>Summer Training: Blood Bank Management System</li>
		    		<li>Minor Project: Campus Recruitment System</li>
		    		<li>Major Project: SOCIAMA (Social Media)</li>
		    	</ul>
		    	And I have also done personal projects which you can see in my GitHub Account whose link is at the bottom of this page. And my other two projects which are hosted are:
		    	<ul>
		    		<li><a href="http://coinage.epizy.com/" target="_blank">Coinage</a> - Coin collection website.</li>
		    		<li><a href="https://hi2u.epizy.com/" target="_blank">Hi2U</a> - Social Media with OTP verification and SSL Certified</li>
		    	</ul>
